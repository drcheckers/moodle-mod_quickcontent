README mod_quickcontent

Quickcontent is a moodle 2 block that allows rapid deployment of content to 
moodle courses.

The principal is to allow content with absolute minimum data entry - content created 
can subsequently be edited by 'experts' to explore and modify the wide range of advanced 
features moodle has to offer.

Essentially quickcontent appeals to beginners, providing a short on-ramp for users
new to moodle, and to experts who want to deploy content quickly ...

quickcontent is a psuedo-mod - it is a front generator of actvities that once created
behave just as the activity would of if generated through the traditional route.
